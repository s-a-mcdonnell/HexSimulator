# HexWorld: A Discrete Hexagonal 2-D Physics Simulator

## Summary
HexWorld is a discrete and deterministic 2-D hexagonal physics simulator in which any hex can move in one of six directions across the hexagonal grid. <br/>
<br/>
HexWorld was created by Skyler McDonnell (@s-a-mcdonnell), Allison Klingler (@amklinglerr), Nahia Pino (@NahiaP), Richa D'Mello(@RichaDMello), and Crawford Dawson (@ddawson97) as a part of the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) 2024 at Amherst College, under Professor Scott Alfeld.
The implementation of the A* Search algorithm for hex agents was done by Nahia and Richa.

## How to Install/Run
To install dependencies: <br/>
`pip install -r requirements.txt` <br/>

To run the simulation: <br/>
Describe the start state in `initial_state.txt` <br/>
`python hex_tester.py` (or use `python3`, `py`, etc. as required by your operating system and version of Python).
